# WideStochNet

This repository contains PyTorch code for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09798">Wide Stochastic Networks</a>.

A new PAC-Bayesian training method is implemented.

There are a few examples of how to run the code in the `main.py` script.

For any question, feel free to contact me.
